## Instructions

```
wget https://github.com/Smartrak/docker-registry-build/archive/master.tar.gz
tar -zxf docker-registry-build-master.tar.gz
cd docker-registry-build-master
sudo sh ./step1.sh `whoami`
```

log out and back in (Your user is now in the docker group)

```
cd docker-registry-build-master
nano config.yml
```

Change the last line (secret)

```
sh ./step2.sh
```

Try open http://dockerregistryhost:5000/
Should get "404 page not found"

```
sh ./step3.sh
```

Now we have the registry running, we need to put nginx in front
